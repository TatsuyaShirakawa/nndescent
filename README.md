# nndescent

This code implements following paper:

    Wei Dong et al., "Efficient K-Nearest Neighbor Graph Construction for Generic Similarity Measures", WWW11
    
Some additional join algorithms are added:
- join the center node to its nbd nodes
- random join (join random nodes)
- randomly break the tie

## Build Requirements

- C++ compiler (needed support for C++11 or later)
